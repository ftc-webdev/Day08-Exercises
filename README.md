# Day08-Exercises – 17/10/23
Just to note that there were no Day07 exercises.
## Task 01 – Image Slider: 
The webpage contains a static image. The company would now like a cycling image banner to allow for better showcasing of their work. Implement a suitable client side script to allow for this feature.
- I would like us to take the most modular approach we can achieve to this task.
- Lets create a slider module. 
- The slider module should have the left and right navigation images.
- We might use a file list module to ease the creation of lists of files, by providing default paths and extensions for files.
- We need to display the file list as a ribbon – this should be its own module. 
- The slider module needs to insert a hidden popover container for the “current” image. This could also be a module. Consider how we could standardise the popover container (and open close behaviours), with custom inner content. 
- The HTML and CSS for each module should be generated by the module itself.
- We should write a module to help us generate HTML (and CSS) to eliminate common errors.
